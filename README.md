Detect and Kill Adblock(ers): Ways to mess (and bypass Adblock blockers) with adblocking software and its users.

[See it in action here.](https://liltinkerer.github.io/detect-and-kill-adblock/)

## How [does it](https://github.com/liltinkerer/detect-and-kill-adblock/blob/master/detect_adblock.js) work?

* Create a fake ad, insert it in the DOM, but hide it from the user's viewport.  
* Check if adblocking software is working by hiding the fake ad.  
* If so, add class `.ab` to body or generate warnings/nag-screens.

## Ways to mess with adblockers even further
